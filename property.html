        <h3> assumptions </h3>
        the content below is written on assumption that you have already scoured through the various Real Estate websites and found a property that you are interested in and meets your criteria
        </p>&nbsp</p>
        <h1> Step 1 - Contact the REA </h1>
        The first step is to locate the best contact number for the REA (Real Estate Agent) that is selling the property. Once you have that, send the REA a brief text message to let them know you are interested in the property. If there is no price guide given on the website (eg "NEW TO MARKET!" or "CALL FOR PRICE GUIDE"), ask the REA for a price guide so that you can start to think about your offer figure and overall strategy
        </p>
        The REA may offer to send you a digital brochure, or ask for more of your details, in order to get you on their list of potential buyers. A digital brochue usually contains a brief overview of the property for sale, as well as any supporting documentation related to the sale of the house (eg REIWA General Conditions, Certificate of Title, an example O&A (Offer & Acceptance) for dealing, Strata Title Acts and/or Schedules)
        </p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1> Step 2 - Attend the home open </h1>
        If the property was listed on the Real Estate website during the working week (Monday to Friday), chances are it will have a scheduled date and time for an open inspect (home open) on the Saturday or Sunday of that same week. This information should be detailed on the website, and if not, can be obtained by asking the REA via text message or email. 
        </p>
        Attending the home open is critical, without much explanation needed. The way the property is detailed on the Real Estate website is done so to make the property look as appealing as possible. The REA will use many tricks to make the property look nicer than what it may really be. The most common trick used is in regards to the photos of the inside of the property. Most the time, the rooms in the property look much bigger in the photos than they really are in real life. The REA may also use old photos of the property, taken during times when it was not being lived in, or most in a better condition than currently.
        </p>
        If the property is older and definitely requires some development (no matter how big or small), it may be advisable to bring a friend who has experience with property development or is a tradesman. Using their experiences and knowledge, they may be able to pick up on details that you are not aware of, and advise you of some cost estimates for any development you have in mind.
